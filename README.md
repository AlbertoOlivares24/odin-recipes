## Purpose
This is a simple website meant to complete one of the projects in TheOdinProject curriculum and practice basic HTML & Git skills.

## Reflection
Although this was a basic project, where I thought I got everything right on the first try, I made a mistake. Everything looked fine on my live preview of the page, and when I hosted it on the browser I noticed something was missing. The images. 

After some research and backtracking through TheOdinProject I recalled the concept of absolute vs relative paths. 

My images needed to reference the parent directory when used on the web, as even though my live preview took advantage of being ran locally and understood simply having /img/FILE-NAME, the web needed more specification. 

Although this is a small problem, and didnt take much too fix. It felt good to catch it quickly due to TheOdinProject teaching me about the fundamentals of programming.
